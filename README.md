# Hekky OSC

An OSC Library for C++, based on [CoreOSC](https://github.com/PaciStardust/CoreOSC-UTF8).

OSC libraries in C++ suck. The APIs are either extremely verbose, the library has too many dependencies and is a nightmare to get working, or difficult to use without leaking memory.

I'm also using this library as an excuse to learn C++ better and improve my ability to write good C++ code.
